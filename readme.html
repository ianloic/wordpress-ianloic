      <ul>
        <li><strong>PHP4</strong> (version 4.0.6 or higher)</li>
        <li><strong>MySQL</strong> (version 3.23.23 or higher)</li>

      <p>The link will help promote <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> 
        and is its only mean of promotion. </p>
      <p>WordPress is built from b2, which comes from Michel V. We wouldn't be 
        here without him, so why don't you grab him something from his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry-address-select-done/1XKLC38KDUPXR/103-8901342-4908609">wishlist</a>?</p>
      <p>This document is currently beta stage, we'll be updating it extensively 
        as WordPress matures.</p>
      <h1 id="installation">Installation:</h1>
      <h2>New users: 5-minute install.</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Unzip the package in an empty directory.</li>
        <li>Open b2config.php in a text editor, and modify the variables as explained 
          in the comments. Comments are lines that start with # or /* or //</li>
        <li>Upload everything. This release is designed to sit in your root folder, 
          IE the folder where your WordPress-powered page will reside.</li>
        <li>CHMOD 666 the <code>weblogs.com.changes.cache</code> file.</li>
        <li> Launch <a href="wp-admin/wp-install.php">wp-install.php</a> in your 
          browser. This should setup the MySQL database for your blog. If there 
          is an error, double check your b2config.php file, and try again. If 
          it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support 
          forums</a> and make a post with all the information about the failure 
          (error messages, etc), and your setup (the PHP and MySQL versions on 
          your server, and the browser you were using). <strong>Note the password 
          given to you.</strong></li>
        <li> Go to <a href="b2login.php">b2login.php</a> and sign in with the 
          login &quot;admin&quot; and the password given to you by the install 
          script. Then click on the menu 'My Profile', and change the password. 
          Note: you need javascript enabled to launch the profile popup window.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Some notes:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Whenever you want to post something, just open a browser and go to 
          b2login.php to log in and post.</li>
        <li>You can also use a bookmarklet and/or a sidebar (IE5+/NS6+) to post.</li>
        <li> You can also post through the Blogger API, <a href="#xmlrpc">click 
          here</a> for more info.</li>
        <li> Your site's blog is on b2.php (simple template) and index.php (CSS 
          template), you can rename this file to index.php or any other name you 
          fancy (provided it bears the php extension or is interpreted as a php 
          file by your server).</li>
        <li> You can also copy b2.php into a new file and modify that new file, 
          it will work too ;)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Users upgrading from b2 v0.6.1 to WordPress v0.7:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All you <em>really</em> have to do is replace all the files with newer 
          versions and run <a href="javascript:window.close()">b2-2-wp.php</a> 
          and you should be ready to go.</li>
        <li>If you're using an older version of b2, it's probably a good idea 
          to upgrade to at least .6.1 before making the leap to WordPress.</li>
        <li>The templates are so much better, and there is so much more going 
          on than before it's probably worth it to start from scratch and work 
          back to your design.</li>
        <li>You can keeep your <code>b2config.php</code> file if you want to, 
          but it is <strong>very important</strong> that you take the last few 
          lines from the WordPress and add those in, otherwise, nothing will work.</li>
        <li>WordPress issues should be discussed in our <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support 
          forums</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Back up</strong> your database before you do anything. Yes, 
          you. Right now.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="templates">Template(s):</h1>
      <h2>First notes:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enclosed is an example of a template, in the file b2.php. You can 
          rename this file to &quot;index.php&quot;or something else (recent b2 
          versions have a default index.php, which is an elaborate CSS-based template).</li>
        <li>You can have any number of template files, since all they do is extract 
          the posts from the database.</li>
        <li>Pseudo-template for the comments is in b2comments.php. You needn't 
          rename this file, but you can edit it.</li>
        <li>The only thing to remember is that it's not actually a template, but 
          a PHP file that you're manipulating. So when you see &quot;don't delete 
          this line&quot;, you know you mustn't, unless you want to have a broken 
          page.</li>
        <li>Required lines are: the first lines that call blog.header.php, the 
          lines with the &quot;while&quot; statement, and the ones with just &quot;}&quot; 
          (it ends the while loop).</li>
        <li>Between the &quot;while&quot; line and the &quot;}&quot;, is the template 
          for your posts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Notes about parameters:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Some template tags can accept optional parameters between the parenthesis 
          <strong>()</strong>.</li>
        <li>To add a parameter to a tag, enclose it between quotes and put it 
          between the <strong>()</strong>.<br />
          Example: <code>&lt;?php my_tag("my parameter"); ?></code></li>
        <li>You may have to put several parameters, for that you separate them 
          with commas.<br />
          Example: <code>&lt;?php my_tag("first param","second param"); ?></code></li>
        <li>The order of parameters is important. If a function accepts 2 parameters 
          and you only want to set the second one, you still have to provide the 
          first one, and so on for any number of parameters.<br />
          Example: <code>&lt;?php my_tag("","second param"); ?></code></li>
        <li>Some template tags, like the_date(), display something only if in 
          some conditions. They generally accept parameters to display something 
          before and after them only when they display something.<br />
          Example: <code>&lt;?php the_title("&lt;h1>","&lt;/h1>"); ?></code> would 
          display &lt;h1>title of the post&lt;/h1> only if the post has a title<br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Template tags:</h1>
      <blockquote> <strong>&lt;?php the_date() ?&gt;</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courrier,mono; color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">*</span><br />
        the date of the post. example: 03.07.01 (default is dd.mm.yy).<br />
        the date is displayed only on new days. for example if you got 10 posts 
        on the same day, the date for this day is displayed only once.<br />
        <div class="params">Parameters: 
          <ul>
            <li>format string (default: "d.m.y")</li>
            <li>string to display before the date (default is blank)</li>
            <li>string to display after the date (default is blank)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_time() ?&gt;</strong><br />
        the time of the post. example: 18:37:00 (default is hh:mm:ss)<br />
        <div class="params">Parameters: 
          <ul>
            <li>format string (default: "H:i:s")</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> you can change the way the date &amp; time are 
        displayed in the Options page.<br />
        once you understand the format strings for the date &amp; time (explained 
        in the Options page), you can change the display right on the template: 
        for example, <strong>the_date(</strong><em>&quot;d.m.Y&quot;</em><strong>)</strong> 
        to have dates like 25.12.2001, <strong>the_time(</strong><em>&quot;B&quot;</em><strong>)</strong> 
        to have Swatch Internet Time.<br />
        If you change the display of the date on the template, changing it from 
        the options page won't have any effect.br /> <br />
        <strong>Note about the_date():</strong> if you want all your posts to 
        bear the date, you'll have to use the_time() instead, with a date format 
        string. for example, to have all your posts show like &quot;25.12.2001 
        @ 8:04:50 AM&quot; you'll have the_time(&quot;d.m.Y @ g:i:s A&quot;). 
        you can also repeat this template tag 2 times with 2 different formats: 
        the_time(&quot;d.m.Y&quot;) for the date, and then later the_time(&quot;g:i:s 
        A&quot;) for the time of the day.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_weekday() ?&gt;</strong><br />
        This displays the day of the week when the post was made. It works like 
        the_time(), in that it would appear at every post. Weekdays can be obtained 
        with a custom date format string in the_time() or the_date(), but for 
        non-english weekdays you have to edit b2config.php<br />
        <strong>Note: this tag is OBSOLETE, the_time() and the_date() now use 
        weekdays/months from b2config.php</strong><br />
        <br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_weekday_date() ?&gt;</strong> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courrier, mono; color: #ff9900; font-weight:bold;">*</span><br />
        Like the_weekday(), but works like the_date(), in that it would appear 
        only on new days.<br />
        <strong>Note: this tag is OBSOLETE, the_time() and the_date() now use 
        weekdays/months from b2config.php</strong><br />
        <div class="params">Parameters: 
          <ul>
            <li>string to display before the weekday_date (default is blank)</li>
            <li>string to display after the weekday_date (default is blank)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_ID() ?&gt;<br />
        </strong>the ID (number) of the post.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_title() ?&gt;<br />
        </strong>The title of the post.<br />
        <div class="params">Parameters: 
          <ul>
            <li>string to display before the title (default is blank)</li>
            <li>string to display after the title (default is blank)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_content() ?&gt; <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courrier, mono; color: #ff9900; font-weight:bold;">*</span><br />
        </strong>The text of the post.<br />
        <div class="params">Parameters: 
          <ul>
            <li>text to display for the link to the complete entry (default is 
              <em>'(more...)'</em>)</li>
            <li>0 or 1, whether you want to show the teaser message or not, when 
              showing the complete text (default is 1)</li>
            <li>a filename of another template, if you want the 'more' link to 
              link to a different template for the complete text of the extended 
              entry (default is the current template)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        For example <em>&lt;?php the_content(&quot;read more&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;blah.php&quot;) 
        ?&gt;</em> would display a link to <em>blah.php</em>, with the link text 
        <em>read more</em>, and won't display the teaser message.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courrier, mono; color: #ff9900; font-weight:bold;">*</span> 
        To enter an extended entry, just type <em>&lt;!--more--&gt;</em> in your 
        entry. The part before that comment is the teaser, the part after it is 
        the extended entry. To force the extended entry not to show the teaser 
        message, type <em>&lt;!--noteaser--&gt;</em> somewhere in your entry.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courrier, mono; color: #ff9900; font-weight:bold;">*</span> 
        To enter an entry with several pages, just type <em>&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;</em> 
        in your entry to start a new page.<br />
        <br />
        <br />

        This tag is out of the b2 loop.<br />
        It outputs the title of the post when you load the page with ?p= (see 
        'Usage' section for explanation). When the weblog page is loaded without 
        ?p=, this tag doesn't display anything. Generally, you could use it like 
        this:<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo('name') ?&gt;&lt;?php single_post_title()

        This tag is out of the b2 loop.<br />
        It outputs the title of the category when you load the page with ?cat= 
        (see 'Usage' section for explanation). When the weblog page is loaded 
        without ?cat=, this tag doesn't display anything. Generally, you could 
        use it like this:<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo('name') ?&gt;&lt;?php single_cat_title()

        <strong>&lt;?php single_month_title() ?&gt;</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courrier,mono; color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">*</span><br />
        This tag is out of the b2 loop.<br />
        It outputs the name of the month when you load the page with ?m= (see 
        'Usage' section for explanation). When the weblog page is loaded without 
        ?m=, this tag doesn't display anything. Generally, you could use it like 
        this:<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo('name') ?&gt;&lt;?php single_month_title() 
        ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br />

        </div>
        <br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> The above three functions can be used together 
        to produce the Title of the page:<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo('name') ?&gt;&lt;?php single_post_title(' 
        :: ') ?&gt;&lt;?php single_cat_title(' :: ') ?&gt;&lt;?php single_month_title(' 
        :: ') ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br />
        Only one, if any, of these functions will produce output, thus the page 
        Title can be customize to the task being done. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>More about the author</strong> of the post ? Here goes:<br />
        <br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_email() ?&gt; - </strong> the author's email.<br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_url() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's url.<br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_email() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's number 
        of posts.<br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_icq() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's ICQ number.<br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_aim() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's AIM handle.<br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_yim() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's Yahoo 
        Messenger handle.<br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_msn() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's MSN Messenger

        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_login() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's login 
        name in b2. If you want some static data about the author, this is what 
        you're searching for. You can, for example, associate a picture with an 
        author, like this: <em>&lt;img src=&quot;pictures/&lt;?php the_author_login() 
        ?&gt;.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;</em><br />
        <strong>&lt;?php the_author_ID() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's ID number 
        in b2. This number is automatically set when the user registers: to see 
        the ID of an user, go to the Team page. This is static data too, so you 
        can use it like the_author_login() in associating stuff with authors.<br />
        <br />
        <strong><br />

        <br />

        This tag differs from v0.5's tag because in v0.5 and prior, it would only

      <a name="usage"></a> <h1>Query String Usage:</h1>
      <p>WordPress relies a lot on the query string, these variables passed with 
        the URL (note: to pass variables in the querystring, preceed the first 
        variable name with a '?' question mark and every other variables with 
        a '&amp;' sign.)</p>
      <p>Most of the time you won't have to do anything about it, but if you want 
        to know how it works, it's here:</p>
      <p>How to use the query string:</p>
      <blockquote> index.php<strong>?m=200107</strong> will display the month 
        of July 2001.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?m=20010701</strong> will display all posts from July 
        1st, 2001.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?w=20</strong> will display the posts from the 20th week 
        of the year, where January 1st is in the first week (according to PHP).<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?p=50</strong> will display the post labeled #50 in the 
        database.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?s=blue+house</strong> will display the posts that match 
        the search request &quot;blue house&quot;.<br />
        here is the code for a simple search box:<br />
        <br />
        <code>&lt;form name=&quot;searchform&quot; action=&quot;&lt;?php echo 
        $PHP_SELF ?&gt;&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;<br />
        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;s&quot; /&gt;<br />
        &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;search&quot; 
        /&gt;<br />
        &lt;/form&gt; </code><br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?cat=1</strong> will display all posts that belong to 
        category #1 (1 is the default). you can add/rename/delete categories from 
        b2's interface.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?author=1</strong> will display all posts from the author 
        #1<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?p=50&c=1</strong> will display the comments and a form 
        to add a comment below the post.<br />
        you should use this variable only with <strong>p=</strong>, example: index.php<strong>?p=50&amp;c=1</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?p=50&tb=1</strong> will display the TrackBacks to the 
        post #50.<br />
        you should use this variable only with <strong>p=</strong>, example: index.php<strong>?p=50&amp;tb=1</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?p=50&pb=1</strong> will display the Pingbacks to the 
        post #50.<br />
        you should use this variable only with <strong>p=</strong>, example: index.php<strong>?p=50&amp;pb=1</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?p=50&more=1</strong> will display the extended entries' 
        text. this, too, should be used only with <strong>p=</strong>, for individual 
        entries.<br />
        <br />
        index.php<strong>?p=50&page=1</strong> will display the first page of 
        post #50. this, again, should be used only with <strong>p=</strong>, for 
        individual entries.<br />
        <br />
        You can also mix these variables, example: index.php<strong>?m=200107&amp;s=hotdog</strong> 
        will display the posts that match the search request &quot;hotdog&quot;, 
        but only in July 2001. </blockquote>

      <a name="xmlrpc"></a> <h1>XML-RPC Interface:</h1>
      <p>WordPress now has a XMLRPC interface. The only API available right now 
        is the Blogger API (complete specs <a href="http://www.tswoam.co.uk/blogger_method_listing.html">here</a>). 
        There are talks about a new API that would cover a lot of weblog/CMS systems 
        in the future: when it's ready, WordPress will support it.</p>
      <p> The <a href="http://plant.blogger.com/api">Blogger API</a> has been 
        completely emulated on WordPress, with some little differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>using <em>blogger.getRecentPosts</em> with the number 'zero' returns 
          all posts in the blog</li>
        <li><em>blogger.getTemplate</em> fetches your file $blogfilename (as specified 
          in the config), while <em>blogger.setTemplate</em> overwrites it with 
          the edited data</li>
        <li><em>blogger.getUsersBlogs</em> is a dummy function that returns '1' 
          and $blogname, since b2 supports only one blog as of now</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you use blogger.newPost, your post is submitted without title and 
        in category #1.</p>
      <p> However, you can type &lt;title>my title&lt;/title> and/or &lt;category>2&lt;category> 
        in the body of your post to make its title be 'my title' and its category 
        be #2 (refer to your categories section to find out the ID numbers of 
        the categories). b2 would then delete that extra info from the body of 
        your post once it is posted.</p>
      <p> You can now post to your b2 blog with tools like <a href="http://blogbuddy.sourceforge.net">BlogBuddy</a>, 
        <a href="http://bloggar.cjb.net">Bloggar</a>, <a href="http://www.ubique.ch/wapblogger/">WapBlogger</a> 
        (post from your Wap cellphone!), <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio 
        Userland</a> (which means you can use Radio's email-to-blog feature), 
        and other tools that support the Blogger API ! :)</p>
      <p>Your XMLRPC server/path are as described here: if you login to b2 on 
        http://mydomain.com/me/b2login.php, then you have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>server: http://mydomain.com/me</li>
        <li>path: /me/xmlrpc.php</li>
        <li>complete URL (just in case): http://mydomain.com/me/xmlrpc.php</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's also a b2-specific method: b2.getCategories. Request it with 
        3 strings: blog_ID (use '1'), username, password. The response is an array 
        of structs with strings categoryID and categoryName.<br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <a name="postviaemail"></a> <h1>Post via Email:</h1>
      <p>You can post news from an email client!<br />
        But first you'll have to edit b2config.php, filling the appropriate values 
        for your POP3 email account (this interface doesn't support IMAP yet, 
        only POP3, sorry).</p>
      <p> Once you have edited the config options, you can make your webserver 
        execute b2mail.php every set amount of time (depending on your host's 
        performance, this script can be resource intensive, so don't make it run 
        every minute or you'll be kicked).</p>
      <p>You can do it with Cron-jobs, or if your host doesn't support it you 
        can look into the various website-monitoring services, and make them check 
        your b2mail.php URL.</p>
      <h2> Preliminary advice:</h2>
      <p> It is strongly advised to send your email as text-only (Outlook and 
        Outlook Express default to 'html', which may cause problems), but HTML 
        email could work (the script would strip all your html tags though...).</p>
      <p>It is also advised not to use your public email address, but create a 
        new one especially for this script. If you use your public email address 
        and the script goes crazy posting every email on your blog and deleting 
        all your emails, I can't take responsibility for this.</p>
      <p>Make sure you delete any email sent to your blog in your 'Sent' folder 
        too, just in case (you don't want someone to find your login and password 
        in the 'Sent' folder).</p>
      <p> The script will <i>delete</i> the emails that were used to post stuff 
        on your weblog if it successfully posted your stuff. If it didn't manage 
        to post, the email is not deleted.</p>
      <h2>How to post:</h2>
      <p>Now to post something, here's how your email should look like:</p>
      <div class="params"> <b>To:</b> address@domain.com <span style='color: #999'>(you 
        set it in the config file)</span><br />
        <b>Subject:</b> blog:the post's title <span style='color: #999'>(you can 
        change 'blog:' in the config file)</span><br />
        <b>Body:</b><br>
        login:password <span style='color: #999'>(example: <i>Jack:Starwars</i>)</span><br />
        The content of the post, blah blah blah.<br />
        More blah blah. ___ </div>
      <p> Subject must start with 'blog:', or any string you set in the config 
        file (so that the script doesn't check EVERY email in your mailbox).</p>
      <p>Body's first line must always be login:password, else the script will 
        just skip the email.<br />
        If you don't use '___' (or any body terminator that you set in the config 
        file), the script will post the whole body, which is not what you want 
        if you send email with Yahoo or Hotmail (you don't want their ads on your 
        blog, do you ?).</p>
      <h2>Special cases for mobile phone email:</h2>
      <p> Some mobile phone service providers may allow you to send email with 
        your mobile phone or PDA, but on such devices you can't always include 
        line breaks. In such case, you have to set <i>$use_phoneemail = 1</i> 
        in b2config.php, and then here's how you write the email:</p>
      <div class="params"> <b>To:</b> address@domain.com<br />
        <b>Subject:</b> blog:the post's title <b>:::</b><br />
        <b>Body:</b><br>
        login:password <b>:::</b> The content of the post, blah blah blah.___ 
      </div>
      <p>You will have to append ':::' (or whatever string you set in the config 
        file) after the subject, and after the login:password.<br />
        <br />
        Some mobile phone service providers may not allow you to set a subject, 
        and they'll make the subject be the first characters of the body, in which 
        case you would send an email like this:</p>
      <div class="params"> <b>To:</b> address@domain.com<br />
        <b>Body:</b><br>
        blog:the post's title <b>:::</b> login:password <b>:::</b> The content 
        of the post, blah blah blah.___ </div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <a name="notes"></a> <h1>Notes: </h1>
      <p>On multi-user:</p>
      <p>New users can register with <code>b2register.php</code>. Then you (as 
        an admin) click the &quot;+&quot; next to their name on the Team page 
        in admin to upgrade their level to 1 or more, so they can post. If you 
        don't want an user to post anymore, just click &quot;-&quot; until their 
        level is 0.</p>
      <p>Note: you can now disable users registration altogether from the config 
        file.</p>
      <p><strong>Levels</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 0 - new user: can't post.</li>
        <li>1 - user: can post &amp; edit/delete their own posts.</li>
        <li>3 &amp; more - admin: can post, edit/delete other people's posts, 
          and change the options.</li>
        <li>Any user whose level is higher than 1, can edit/delete the posts and 
          change the level of users whose level is inferior. Example: a level 
          2 user is not an admin, but can edit the posts of level 1 users, and 
          up the level of a new user from 0 to 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Usually, you'll want to have a team of only level 1 users except you. 
        ;)</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> you can modify a variable in b2config.php, to 
        enable new users to post once they've registered.</p>
      <p>If you don't want users to register on your blog at all, just delete 
        b2register.php once you've registered your user account. </p>
      <h1><br />
        Final notes:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>WordPress is functionnal, but a lot of coding and code clean-up remain 
          to be done.</li>
        <li>If you've got suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you found a bug, 
          why not joining us in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">Support 
          Forums</a>?</li>
        <li>If you can code in PHP, you'll see the structure of b2 is flexible 
          enough to allow for more functions and sections to be added.</li>
