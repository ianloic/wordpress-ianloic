<ul> 
  <li><strong>PHP4</strong> (version 4.0.6 or higher)</li> 
  <li><strong>MySQL</strong> (version 3.23.23 or higher)</li> 
  <li>... and a link to <a href="http://wordpress.org">http://wordpress.org</a> on your site.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The link will help promote <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> and is its only mean of promotion. </p> 
<p>WordPress is built from b2, which comes from Michel V. We wouldn't be here without him, so why don't you grab him something from his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry-address-select-done/1XKLC38KDUPXR/103-8901342-4908609">wishlist</a>? You can also support the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/">WordPress developers</a>. </p> 
<p>This document is currently <em>beta</em> stage, we'll be updating it extensively as WordPress matures. There is also <a href="http://wordpress.org/docs/">online documentation</a> under development. </p> 
<h1 id="installation">Installation:</h1> 
<h2>New users: 5-minute install.</h2> 
<ol> 
  <li>Unzip the package in an empty directory.</li> 
  <li>Copy wp-config.sample.php to wp-config.php. Open wp-config.php in a text editor and modify the variables as explained in the comments. Comments are lines that start with <code>/*</code> or <code>//</code></li> 
  <li>Upload everything. This release is designed to sit in your root folder, IE the folder where your WordPress-powered page will reside.</li> 
  <li>The weblogs.com cache file needs to be writable by the web server. <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/A_quick_and_dirty_chmod_Tutorial/18/541/">CHMOD 666</a> the <code>weblogs.com.changes.cache</code> file. </li> 
  <li> Launch <a href="wp-admin/wp-install.php">wp-install.php</a> in your browser. This should setup the MySQL database for your blog. If there is an error, double check your wp-config.php file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a> and make a post with all the information about the failure (error messages, etc), and your setup (the PHP and MySQL versions on your server, and the browser you were using). <strong>Note the password given to you.</strong></li> 
  <li> Go to <a href="b2login.php">b2login.php</a> and sign in with the login "admin" and the password given to you by the install script. Then click on the menu 'My Profile', and change the password. Note: you need javascript enabled to launch the profile popup window.</li> 
</ol> 
<h2>Some notes:</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Whenever you want to post something, just open a browser and go to b2login.php to log in and post.</li> 
  <li>You can also use a bookmarklet and/or a sidebar (IE5+/NS6+) to post.</li> 
  <li> You can also post through the Blogger API, <a href="#xmlrpc">click here</a> for more info.</li> 
  <li> Your site's blog is on b2.php (simple template) and index.php (CSS template), you can rename this file to index.php or any other name you fancy (provided it bears the php extension or is interpreted as a php file by your server).</li> 
  <li> You can also copy b2.php into a new file and modify that new file, it will work too ;)</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Upgrading from b2 v0.6.1 to WordPress v0.7:</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>All you <em>really</em> have to do is replace all the files with newer versions and run <a href="javascript:window.close()">b2-2-wp.php</a> and you should be ready to go.</li> 
  <li>If you're using an older version of b2, it's probably a good idea to upgrade to at least .6.1 before making the leap to WordPress.</li> 
  <li>The templates are better and structured slightly differently, so it might be worth it to start from scratch and work back to your design.</li> 
  <li>You <em>must</em> update <code>wp-config.php</code>.</li> 
  <li>WordPress issues should be discussed in our <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a>.</li> 
  <li><strong>Back up</strong> your database before you do anything. Yes, you. Right now.</li> 
</ul> 
<h1 id="templates">Templates:</h1> 
<h2>First notes:</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Enclosed is an example of a template, in the file b2.php. You can rename this file to "index.php"or something else (recent b2 versions have a default index.php, which is an elaborate CSS-based template).</li> 
  <li>You can have any number of template files, since all they do is extract the posts from the database.</li> 
  <li>Pseudo-template for the comments is in b2comments.php. You needn't rename this file, but you can edit it.</li> 
  <li>The only thing to remember is that it's not actually a template, but a PHP file that you're manipulating. So when you see "don't delete this line", you know you mustn't, unless you want to have a broken page.</li> 
  <li>Required lines are: the first lines that call blog.header.php, the lines with the "while" statement, and the ones with just "}" (it ends the while loop).</li> 
  <li>Between the "while" line and the "}", is the template for your posts.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Notes about parameters:</h2> 
<ol> 
  <li> Some template tags can accept optional parameters between the parentheses <strong>()</strong>.</li> 
  <li>To add a parameter to a tag, enclose it between quotes and put it between the <strong>()</strong>.<br /> 
    Example: <code>&lt;?php my_tag('my parameter'); ?&gt;</code></li> 
  <li>You may have to put several parameters, for that you separate them with commas.<br /> 
    Example: <code>&lt;?php my_tag("first param", "second param"); ?&gt;</code></li> 
  <li>The order of parameters is important. If a function accepts 2 parameters and you only want to set the second one, you still have to provide the first one, and so on for any number of parameters.<br /> 
    Example: <code>&lt;?php my_tag("", "second param"); ?&gt;</code></li> 
  <li>Some template tags, like the_date(), display something only if in some conditions. They generally accept parameters to display something before and after them only when they display something.<br />
  Example: <code>&lt;?php the_title("&lt;h1&gt;", "&lt;/h1&gt;"); ?&gt;</code> would display &lt;h1&gt;title of the post&lt;/h1&gt; only if the post has a title </li> 
</ol> 
<h1>Template tags:</h1> 
 <strong>&lt;?php the_date() ?&gt;</strong> <br /> 
the date of the post. example: 03.07.01 (default is dd.mm.yy).<br /> 
the date is displayed only on new days. for example if you got 10 posts on the same day, the date for this day is displayed only once.<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>format string (default: "d.m.y")</li> 
    <li>string to display before the date (default is blank)</li> 
    <li>string to display after the date (default is blank)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_time() ?&gt;</strong><br /> 
the time of the post. example: 18:37:00 (default is hh:mm:ss)<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>format string (default: "H:i:s")</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<strong>Note:</strong> you can change the way the date &amp; time are displayed in the Options page.<br />
once you understand the format strings for the date &amp; time (explained in the Options page), you can change the display right on the template: for example, <strong>the_date(</strong><em>"d.m.Y"</em><strong>)</strong> to have dates like 25.12.2001, <strong>the_time(</strong><em>"B"</em><strong>)</strong> to have Swatch Internet Time.<br />
If you change the display of the date on the template, changing it from the options page won't have any effect.br /&gt; <br /> 
<strong>Note about the_date():</strong> if you want all your posts to bear the date, you'll have to use the_time() instead, with a date format string. for example, to have all your posts show like "25.12.2001 @ 8:04:50 AM" you'll have the_time("d.m.Y @ g:i:s A"). you can also repeat this template tag 2 times with 2 different formats: the_time("d.m.Y") for the date, and then later the_time("g:i:s A") for the time of the day.<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_weekday() ?&gt;</strong><br /> 
This displays the day of the week when the post was made. It works like the_time(), in that it would appear at every post. Weekdays can be obtained with a custom date format string in the_time() or the_date(), but for non-english weekdays you have to edit day-month-trans.php<br /> 
<strong>Note: this tag is OBSOLETE, the_time() and the_date() now use weekdays/months from day-month-trans.php</strong><br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_weekday_date() ?&gt;</strong> <br /> 
Like the_weekday(), but works like the_date(), in that it would appear only on new days.<br /> 
<strong>Note: this tag is OBSOLETE, the_time() and the_date() now use weekdays/months from day-month-trans.php</strong><br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>string to display before the weekday_date (default is blank)</li> 
    <li>string to display after the weekday_date (default is blank)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_ID() ?&gt;<br /> 
</strong>the ID (number) of the post.<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_title() ?&gt;<br /> 
</strong>The title of the post.<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>string to display before the title (default is blank)</li> 
    <li>string to display after the title (default is blank)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_content() ?&gt; <br /> 
</strong>The text of the post.<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>text to display for the link to the complete entry (default is <em>'(more...)'</em>)</li> 
    <li>0 or 1, whether you want to show the teaser message or not, when showing the complete text (default is 1)</li> 
    <li>a filename of another template, if you want the 'more' link to link to a different template for the complete text of the extended entry (default is the current template)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
For example <em>&lt;?php the_content("read more","0","blah.php") ?&gt;</em> would display a link to <em>blah.php</em>, with the link text <em>read more</em>, and won't display the teaser message.<br /> 
<br /> 
 To enter an extended entry, just type <em>&lt;!--more--&gt;</em> in your entry. The part before that comment is the teaser, the part after it is the extended entry. To force the extended entry not to show the teaser message, type <em>&lt;!--noteaser--&gt;</em> somewhere in your entry.<br /> 
<br /> 
 To enter an entry with several pages, just type <em>&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;</em> in your entry to start a new page.<br /> 
<br />

<strong>&lt;?php the_author_aim() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's AIM handle.<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_author_yim() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's Yahoo Messenger handle.<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_author_msn() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's MSN Messenger handle.<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_author_posts() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's post count.<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_author_login() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's login name in b2. If you want some static data about the author, this is what you're searching for. You can, for example, associate a picture with an author, like this: <em>&lt;img src="pictures/&lt;?php the_author_login() ?&gt;.jpg" border="0"&gt;</em><br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php the_author_ID() ?&gt;</strong> - the author's ID number in b2. This number is automatically set when the user registers: to see the ID of an user, go to the Team page. This is static data too, so you can use it like the_author_login() in associating stuff with authors.<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong><br /> 
Tags for permalinks</strong> are:<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php permalink_anchor() ?&gt; </strong><br />
this will display &lt;a name="..."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, replacing "..." with the ID or the title of the post in the database.<br /> 
<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>string for kind of anchor: either 'id' that displays '50', or 'title' that displays 'title_of_post_50' (default is 'id')</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php permalink_link() ?&gt; <br /> 
</strong>this will display the name of the file followed by #ID to link to the post, in the month archive if archive-mode is "monthly".<br />
note: this tag does not display the link, for this you've got to type &lt;a href="&lt;?php permalink_link() ?&gt;"&gt;text of the link&lt;/a&gt;.<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>file name, in case you want to link the archive to a different template (default is the current template)</li> 
    <li>string for kind of link: either 'id' that appends '#50' to the link, or 'title' that appends '#title_of_post_50' (default is 'id')</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php permalink_single() ?&gt; <br /> 
</strong>this will display the name of the file followed by #ID to link to the entire post (the linked page will also show the extended text on that post if it is an extended entry, and the comments).<br />
note: this tag does not display the link, for this you've got to type &lt;a href="&lt;?php permalink_single() ?&gt;"&gt;text of the link&lt;/a&gt;.<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>file name, in case you want to use a different template for single posts (default is the current template)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Tags for comments, trackback, and pingback</strong> are:<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comments_popup_script() ?&gt; </strong><br /> 
This will include the javascript that is required to open comments, trackback and pingback in popup windows.<br />
You should put this tag before the &lt;/head&gt; tag in your template.<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>width (default is 400)</li> 
    <li>height (default is 400)</li> 
    <li>file name, in case you want to use a different template for comments (default is b2commentspopup.php)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comments_popup_link() ?&gt;</strong><br /> 
This will display the link to open comments in a popup window, with the number of comments.<br /> 
To edit the popup window's template, edit the file b2commentspopup.php (it's the default one for comments popup).<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>string for comment-less posts (default is "no comments")</li> 
    <li>string for posts with one comment (default is "1 comment")</li> 
    <li>string for posts with 2 or more comments (default is "% comments")<br /> 
      Note here that the sign "%" is then replaced by the number of comments.</li> 
    <li>string for CSS class, so you can have a styled link with class="" (default is empty, no CSS class applied)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comments_link() ?&gt;<br /> 
</strong> This is a bit like permalink_link, it will display an URL to the comments page, but again you'll have to create the link tag.<br /> 
<br /> 
Note:<br /> 
The same tags exist for TrackBack and Pingback, respectively named '<b>trackback_link()</b>' and '<b>pingback_link()</b>'. They take the same parameters.<br /> 
<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>file name, in case you want to use a different template for comments (default is the current template)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comments_number() ?&gt;</strong> <br />
This displays the number of comments that have been posted on this post. Example: "5 comments".<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters:
  <ul> 
    <li>string for comment-less posts (default is "no comments")</li> 
    <li>string for posts with one comment (default is "1 comment")</li> 
    <li>string for posts with 2 or more comments (default is "% comments")<br /> 
      Note here that the sign "%" is then replaced by the number of comments.</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
Example: <em>&lt;?php comments_number("no comment","1 comment","% comments") ?&gt;</em><br /> 
<br />
This tag differs from v0.5's tag because in v0.5 and prior, it would only display a number, not a text with it, so you could have terrible things like "1 comments" (doh !)<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Necessary: &lt;?php include("b2comments.php") ?&gt;</strong><br /> 
you'll put this line where you want the comments to be placed on your page.<br /> 
typically, under the post itself. don't worry, the comments only appear if the page is called in the comments mode. (like this: url?c=1)<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Tags that go in b2comments.php:</strong> (these are easy too)<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comment_author() ?&gt;</strong><br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comment_author_email() ?&gt; </strong> - displays the e-mail address, but not the link<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comment_author_url() ?&gt; </strong>- displays the url, but not the link<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comment_author_email_link() ?&gt; </strong> - displays a link to the comment's author's e-mail<br />

<div class="params">Parameters for <strong>comment_author_email_link()</strong> and <strong>comment_author_url_link()</strong>:
  <ul> 
    <li>string for the link (default: "email"/"url" depending on the tag)</li> 
    <li>string to display before the link (default is " - ")</li> 
    <li>string to display after the link (default is blank)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comment_author_IP() ?&gt;</strong> - displays the IP of the comment's author<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php comment_text() ?&gt;<br /> 
&lt;?php comment_date() ?&gt; </strong>- unlike the_date(), this tag appears on every comment<strong><br /> 
&lt;?php comment_time() ?&gt;</strong><br /> 
<div class="params">Parameters for <strong>comment_date()</strong> and <strong>comment_time()</strong>:
  <ul> 
    <li>format string (default is "d.m.y"/"H:i:s" depending on the tag)</li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
<br /> 
<strong>&lt;?php trackback_url() ?&gt; </strong><br /> 
This tag is out of the b2 TrackBacks loop.<br /> 
It will output the URL to TrackBack the post, that other people can copy and use in b2's posting interface to trackback this post.<br /> 
<p>  In b2comments.php, like in the main template file, please keep the first PHP lines, the "while" lines, and the "}" lines.</p>
<p>You can modify the form, but do not remove "&lt;?php echo ... ?&gt;" and all the name="..." attributes.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>To include your archives:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;?php get_archives() ?&gt;</strong></p>
<div class="params">Parameters for <strong>get_archives()</strong>:
  <ul> 
    <li>archivetype: 'postbypost', 'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly' (default is to use the archive_mode setting from the admin interface)</li>
    <li>limit: how many archive links to display (default is to show all)</li>
    <li>format:
      <ul>
        <li>'html': create as &lt;li&gt; items for an HTML list (default)</li>
        <li>'option': create option values for a &lt;select&gt; dropdown menu</li>
        <li>'link': create &lt;link&gt; elements for the &lt;head&gt; section of a page</li>
        <li>'custom': use before and after values to format links</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>before: text to prepend to link</li>
    <li>after: text to append to link</li>
    <li>0 or 1: 1 means to display link counts</li>
  </ul> 
</div>
<br />
<p><strong>To include the calendar:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;?php include("b2calendar.php") ?&gt;</strong><br />
  this will include a table with the current month's calendar, each day when you posted shows a link to this day's posts. You can customise this table with CSS classes: </p>
<div class="params"> <strong>.b2calendarmonth {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style that is used to display the month and year</i><br /> 
  <strong>.b2calendartable {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style of the &lt;table&gt; tag (border etc...)</i><br /> 
  <strong>.b2calendarrow {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style of the &lt;tr&gt; tag</i><br /> 
  <strong>.b2calendarheadercell {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style of the &lt;td&gt; tag that shows the weekdays on the top of the table</i><br /> 
  <strong>.b2calendarcell {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style of the &lt;td&gt; tags that show the days</i><br /> 
  <strong>.b2calendaremptycell {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style of the &lt;td&gt; tags that are empty</i><br /> 
  <strong>.b2calendarlinkpost {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style of the link to the post</i><br /> 
  <strong>.b2calendartoday {}</strong><br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>the style of the day if it is today</i> </div>
<h1 id="usage">Query String Usage:</h1> 
<p>WordPress relies a lot on the query string, these variables passed with the URL (note: to pass variables in the querystring, preceed the first variable name with a '?' question mark and every other variables with a '&amp;' sign.)</p>
<p>Most of the time you won't have to do anything about it, but if you want to know how it works, it's here:</p>
<p>How to use the query string:</p> 
<p>index.php<strong>?m=200107</strong> will display the month of July 2001.</p>
<p>index.php<strong>?m=20010701</strong> will display all posts from July 1st, 2001.</p>
<p>index.php<strong>?w=20</strong> will display the posts from the 20th week of the year, where January 1st is in the first week (according to PHP).</p>
<p>index.php<strong>?p=50</strong> will display the post labeled #50 in the database.</p>
<p>index.php<strong>?s=blue+house</strong> will display the posts that match the search request "blue house".<br />
here is the code for a simple search box:</p>
<p><code>&lt;form name="searchform" action="&lt;?php echo $PHP_SELF ?&gt;" method="get"&gt;<br />
&lt;input type="text" name="s" /&gt;<br />
&lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="search" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/form&gt; </code></p>
<p>index.php<strong>?cat=1</strong> will display all posts that belong to category #1 (1 is the default). you can add/rename/delete categories from b2's interface.</p>
<p>index.php<strong>?author=1</strong> will display all posts from the author #1</p>
<p>index.php<strong>?p=50&amp;c=1</strong> will display the comments and a form to add a comment below the post.<br />
  you should use this variable only with <strong>p=</strong>, example: index.php<strong>?p=50&amp;c=1</strong>.</p>
<p>index.php<strong>?p=50&amp;page=1</strong> will display the first page of post #50. this, again, should be used only with <strong>p=</strong>, for individual entries.</p>
<p>You can also mix these variables, example: index.php<strong>?m=200107&amp;s=hotdog</strong> will display the posts that match the search request "hotdog", but only in July 2001.</p>
<h1 id="xmlrpc">XML-RPC Interface:</h1> 
<p>WordPress has an XMLRPC interface. Currently supported APIs are the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/">Blogger API</a>, <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">metaWeblog API</a>, and the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html">MovableType API</a>. There are talks about a new API that would cover a lot of weblog/CMS systems in the future: when it's ready, WordPress will support it.</p> 
<p> The <a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/">Blogger API</a> has been completely emulated on WordPress, with some little differences:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>using <em>blogger.getRecentPosts</em> with the number 'zero' returns all posts in the blog</li> 
  <li><em>blogger.getTemplate</em> fetches your file $blogfilename (as specified in the config), while <em>blogger.setTemplate</em> overwrites it with the edited data</li> 
  <li><em>blogger.getUsersBlogs</em> is a dummy function that returns '1' and $blogname, since b2 supports only one blog as of now</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you use blogger.newPost, your post is submitted without title and in category #1.</p> 
<p> However, you can type &lt;title&gt;my title&lt;/title&gt; and/or &lt;category&gt;2&lt;category&gt; in the body of your post to make its title be 'my title' and its category be #2 (refer to your categories section to find out the ID numbers of the categories). b2 would then delete that extra info from the body of your post once it is posted.</p> 
<p>The <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">metaWeblog</a> and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html">MovableType</a> APIs are currently supported with the following exceptions:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>metaWeblog.newMediaObject,&nbsp; mt.getRecentPostTitles,&nbsp; and mt.getTrackbackPings are not yet implemented</li> 
  <li>mt.supportedTextFilters is a dummy stub function that returns an empty string</li> 
  <li>keywords are not supported in the MovableType API</li> 
</ul> 
<br /> 
Extended entries in the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html">MovableType API</a> are automatically converted to/from the WordPress &lt;!--more--&gt; tag.<br /> 
<p>You can now post to your b2 blog with tools like <a href="http://blogbuddy.sourceforge.net">BlogBuddy</a>, <a href="http://bloggar.com/">Bloggar</a>, <a href="http://www.ubique.ch/wapblogger/">WapBlogger</a> (post from your Wap cellphone!), <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a> (which means you can use Radio's email-to-blog feature), <a href="http://www.zempt.com/">Zempt</a>, <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">NewzCrawler</a>, and other tools that support the Blogging APIs! :)</p> 
<p>Your XMLRPC server/path are as described here: if you login to b2 on http://example.com/me/b2login.php, then you have:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>server: http://example.com/ (some tools will just want the 'example.com' hostname part)</li> 
  <li>path: /me/xmlrpc.php</li> 
  <li>complete URL (just in case): http://example.com/me/xmlrpc.php</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There's also a b2-specific method: b2.getCategories. Request it with 3 strings: blog_ID (use '1'), username, password. The response is an array of structs with strings categoryID and categoryName.</p> 
<h1 id="postviaemail">Post via Email:</h1> 
<p>You can post news from an email client!<br /> 
  But first you'll have to edit the options on the options screen, filling the appropriate values for your POP3 email account (this interface doesn't support IMAP yet, only POP3, sorry).</p> 
<p> Once you have edited the options, you can make your webserver execute b2mail.php every set amount of time (depending on your host's performance, this script can be resource intensive, so don't make it run every minute or you'll be kicked).</p> 
<p>You can do it with Cron-jobs, or if your host doesn't support it you can look into the various website-monitoring services, and make them check your b2mail.php URL.</p> 
<h2> Preliminary advice:</h2> 
<p> It is strongly advised to send your email as text-only (Outlook and Outlook Express default to 'html', which may cause problems), but HTML email could work (the script would strip all your html tags though...).</p> 
<p>It is also advised not to use your public email address, but create a new one especially for this script. If you use your public email address and the script goes crazy posting every email on your blog and deleting all your emails, I can't take responsibility for this.</p> 
<p>Make sure you delete any email sent to your blog in your 'Sent' folder too, just in case (you don't want someone to find your login and password in the 'Sent' folder).</p> 
<p> The script will <i>delete</i> the emails that were used to post stuff on your weblog if it successfully posted your stuff. If it didn't manage to post, the email is not deleted.</p> 
<h2>How to post:</h2> 
<p>Now to post something, here's how your email should look like:</p> 
<div class="params"> <b>To:</b> address@example.com <span

 style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(you set it in the config file)</span><br /> 
  <b>Subject:</b> blog:the post's title <span

 style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(you can change 'blog:' in the config file)</span><br /> 
  <b>Body:</b><br /> 
  login:password <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(example: <i>Jack:Starwars</i>)</span><br /> 
  The content of the post, blah blah blah.<br /> 
  More blah blah. ___ </div> 
<p> Subject must start with 'blog:', or any string you set in the config file (so that the script doesn't check EVERY email in your mailbox).</p> 
<p>Body's first line must always be login:password, else the script will just skip the email.</p> 
<p> If you don't use '___' (or any body terminator that you set in the config file), the script will post the whole body, which is not what you want if you send email with Yahoo or Hotmail (you don't want their ads on your blog, do you ?).</p> 
<h2>Special cases for mobile phone email:</h2> 
<p> Some mobile phone service providers may allow you to send email with your mobile phone or PDA, but on such devices you can't always include line breaks. In such case, you have to set <i>use_phoneemail = true</i> in the options, and then here's how you write the email:</p> 
<div class="params"> <b>To:</b> address@example.com<br /> 
  <b>Subject:</b> blog:the post's title <b>:::</b><br /> 
  <b>Body:</b><br /> 
  login:password <b>:::</b> The content of the post, blah blah blah.___ </div> 
<p>You will have to append ':::' (or whatever string you set in the config file) after the subject, and after the login:password.</p> 
<p>Some mobile phone service providers may not allow you to set a subject, and they'll make the subject be the first characters of the body, in which case you would send an email like this:</p> 
<div class="params"> <b>To:</b> address@example.com<br /> 
  <b>Body:</b><br /> 
  blog:the post's title <b>:::</b> login:password <b>:::</b> The content of the post, blah blah blah.___ </div> 
<h1 id="notes">Notes:</h1> 
<p>On multi-user:</p> 
<p>New users can register with <code>b2register.php</code>. Then you (as an admin) click the "+" next to their name on the Team page in admin to upgrade their level to 1 or more, so they can post. If you don't want an user to post anymore, just click "-" until their level is 0.</p> 
<p>Note: you can now disable users registration altogether from the config file.</p> 
<p><strong>Levels</strong>:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>0 - new user: can't post.</li> 
  <li>1 - user: can post &amp; edit/delete their own posts.</li> 
  <li>3 &amp; higher - admin: can post, edit/delete other people's posts, and change the options.</li> 
  <li>Any user whose level is higher than 1, can edit/delete the posts and change the level of users whose level is inferior. Example: a level 2 user is not an admin, but can edit the posts of level 1 users, and up the level of a new user from 0 to 1.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Usually, you'll want to have a team of only level 1 users except you. ;)</p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can modify an option on the option screens, to enable new users to post once they've registered.</p> 
<p>If you don't want users to register on your blog at all, just delete b2register.php once you've registered your user account. </p> 
<h1> Final notes:</h1> 
<ul> 
  <li>WordPress is functional, but a lot of coding and code clean-up remain to be done.</li> 
  <li>If you've got suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you found a bug, why not joining us in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">Support Forums</a>?</li> 
  <li>If you can code in PHP, you'll see the structure of WordPress is flexible enough to allow for more functions and sections to be added.</li>
