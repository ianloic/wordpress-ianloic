Roadmap for MU support:
Trustroot should have a * if constant( "VHOST" ) !== 'no'

General usability:
Returns from begin() need better error handling.
Incompatible with Clutter Free. (Global vars?)

Performance:
Verify late binding of library objects implementation.
 - soft check against oid_plugin_enabled & oid_plugin_version options before showing UI elements.
 - hard check before object creation, database operations, and during Options display.
	- failed hard check sets oid_plugin_enabled = False, so subsequent soft check fails.
